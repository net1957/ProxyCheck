It should work on all nix systems, but not on windows due to the lack of support by the therubyracer gem.

You can use Vagrant to test it. A Vagrantfile based on ubuntu/trusty64 is provided.

CONFIGURATION

3. You can limit the proxy field to a list of selectable proxies

   add the environment variable PROXIES with the following format:
      label1;proxy1 url,label2;proxy2 url

   The proxy text box is changed to a select box
